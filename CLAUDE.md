# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**tasker-core-rs** is a high-performance Rust implementation of the core workflow orchestration engine, designed to complement the existing Ruby on Rails **Tasker** engine found at `/Users/petetaylor/projects/tasker-systems/tasker-engine/`. This project leverages Rust's memory safety, fearless parallelism, and performance characteristics to handle computationally intensive workflow orchestration, dependency resolution, and state management operations.

**Architecture**: Delegation-based pattern where Rust implements the complete orchestration core that frameworks (Rails, Python, Node.js) extend through FFI integration with `process()` and `process_results()` hooks.

## Development Roadmap - Source of Truth

**ALWAYS REFER TO**: `docs/roadmap/README.md` as the authoritative source for:
- Current development phase and priorities
- Weekly milestones and success criteria
- Critical placeholder analysis and resolution strategy
- Implementation guidelines and code quality standards

**Current Status**: Phase 1 (Testing Foundation) - Week 1
- **Goal**: Fix critical placeholders through comprehensive integration tests
- **Focus**: Complex workflow tests, SQL function validation, Ruby binding tests
- **Rule**: No new placeholder/stub code - all implementations must be complete

## Code Design Principles

- **No More Placeholders**: All new code must be implemented to completion
- **Testing-Driven**: Use failing tests to expose and fix existing placeholders
- **Sequential Progress**: Complete current phase before proceeding to next
- Use TODO for intentionally delayed future work, but not to sidestep a better pattern

## Testing Guidelines

- As much as possible, tests should go in our tests/ directory, excluding doctests
- Use sqlx::test for tests requiring database access
- Use #[test] on its own for pure unit tests
- **Integration Tests Priority**: Complex workflows reveal system boundaries and force placeholder completion

## MCP Server Integration

**Essential Development Tools**: This project uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to enhance development workflow and capabilities.

### Configured MCP Servers
- **PostgreSQL MCP** (`crystaldba/postgres-mcp`): Database operations, performance analysis, and migration management
- **GitHub Official MCP** (`github/github-mcp-server`): Repository operations, PR management, and CI/CD integration  
- **Cargo Package MCP** (`artmann/package-registry-mcp`): Rust dependency management and security analysis
- **Docker MCP** (`docker/mcp-servers`): Containerized testing and deployment automation
- **Rust Documentation MCP** (`Govcraft/rust-docs-mcp-server`): Real-time Rust best practices and API guidance
- **Context7 MCP** (SSE): Enhanced development context and intelligence
- **Tasker MCP** (Added July 2025): We now have access to all of the mcp servers in .mcp.json and should use them

**Configuration**: See `docs/MCP_TOOLS.md` for detailed setup, capabilities, and integration patterns.

**Benefits**: Enhanced database development, automated dependency management, streamlined CI/CD workflows, and real-time Rust guidance.

## Current Development Context (January 2025)

### Testing-Driven Development Success üéØ
**Approach**: Using comprehensive integration tests to systematically expose and fix critical placeholders
**Philosophy**: Test failures are documentation - they show us exactly what needs to be implemented
**Results**: Methodical identification and resolution of system-breaking issues

### Critical Placeholders Fixed Through Testing ‚úÖ
1. **SQL Schema Alignment** - Fixed `error_steps` vs `failed_steps` column mismatch in TaskExecutionContext
2. **Type System Integrity** - Fixed BigDecimal to f64 conversion in TaskFinalizer 
3. **SQL Type Compatibility** - Fixed `named_step_id` i64 vs i32 mismatch across all components
4. **Database Function Integration** - Verified get_task_execution_context SQL function alignment

### Current Active Investigation üîç
**Step State Initialization Issue**: Integration tests reveal workflow steps are in 'unknown' state instead of expected 'pending' state
- **Error**: `StateTransitionError { step_id: 1, reason: "Step 1 is in invalid state 'unknown', expected one of: [\"pending\", \"in_progress\"]" }`
- **Root Cause**: Either WorkflowStepFactory initialization or SQL function state retrieval issue
- **Test Case**: `test_orchestration_with_real_task` successfully creates task + steps but orchestration fails on state validation

### Foundation Complete ‚úÖ
- **Multi-workspace Architecture**: Main core + Ruby extension workspaces
- **Ruby FFI Integration**: Magnus-based bindings with proper build system  
- **State Machine Framework**: Complete implementation with event publishing
- **Factory System**: Comprehensive test data generation for complex workflows
- **Orchestration Coordinator**: Core structure with async processing
- **Database Layer**: Models, scopes, and SQL functions implemented
- **Git Infrastructure**: Multi-workspace validation hooks and build artifacts management

### Integration Test Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- **MockFrameworkIntegration**: Complete test framework integration for orchestration testing
- **Real Task Creation**: Factory system properly creates tasks with workflow steps
- **Orchestration Flow**: End-to-end test successfully reaches step state validation
- **Systematic Discovery**: Each test run exposes the next critical placeholder requiring implementation

### Implementation Status

#### ‚úÖ Implemented
- **State Machine System**: TaskStateMachine and StepStateMachine with event publishing
- **Factory System**: Complex workflow patterns (Linear, Diamond, Parallel, Tree, Mixed DAG)
- **Ruby Bindings Foundation**: Handler base classes, task initialization, database integration
- **TaskHandlerRegistry**: Complete handler lookup with Ruby class names and YAML templates
- **SQL Function Integration**: High-performance operations leveraging existing tested functions
- **Orchestration Components**: BackoffCalculator, TaskFinalizer, TaskEnqueuer, Error Classification

#### üöß Critical Missing (Phase 1 Focus)
- **Client Handler State Integration**: State transitions in `src/client/{step_handler.rs, task_handler.rs}`
- **Event Publishing Core**: Complete implementation in `src/orchestration/event_publisher.rs`
- **Ruby Framework Integration**: Step delegation in `bindings/ruby/ext/tasker_core/src/handlers.rs`
- **Queue Integration**: Task enqueuing in `src/orchestration/task_enqueuer.rs`
