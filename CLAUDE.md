# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**tasker-core-rs** is a high-performance Rust implementation of the core workflow orchestration engine, designed to complement the existing Ruby on Rails **Tasker** engine found at `/Users/petetaylor/projects/tasker-systems/tasker-engine/`. This project leverages Rust's memory safety, fearless parallelism, and performance characteristics to handle computationally intensive workflow orchestration, dependency resolution, and state management operations.

**Architecture**: Delegation-based pattern where Rust implements the complete orchestration core that frameworks (Rails, Python, Node.js) extend through FFI integration with `process()` and `process_results()` hooks.

## Development Roadmap - Source of Truth

**ALWAYS REFER TO**: `docs/roadmap/README.md` as the authoritative source for:
- Current development phase and priorities
- Weekly milestones and success criteria
- Critical placeholder analysis and resolution strategy
- Implementation guidelines and code quality standards

**Current Status**: Handle-Based FFI Architecture Migration - Foundation Complete
- **Goal**: Systematic migration to handle-based patterns across all FFI components
- **Focus**: Eliminate global lookups, optimize performance, create unified FFI architecture
- **Recent Achievement**: ‚úÖ Revolutionary handle-based FFI architecture implemented and validated
- **Rule**: All FFI operations must use OrchestrationHandle pattern - zero global lookups after handle creation

## Recent Major Achievement: Handle-Based FFI Architecture

### ‚úÖ Handle-Based FFI Architecture (January 2025) 
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FOUNDATION COMPLETE** - Revolutionary architecture eliminating global lookups and connection pool exhaustion
**Impact**: Zero-copy FFI operations, persistent resource references, production-ready performance optimization

#### Key Architecture Features
- **OrchestrationHandle**: Persistent `Arc<OrchestrationSystem>` and `Arc<TestingFactory>` references
- **Zero Global Lookups**: All operations after handle creation use persistent references  
- **Connection Pool Sharing**: Single database pool shared across all FFI operations
- **Handle Lifecycle**: Explicit validation and resource management with 2-hour expiry
- **Ruby Integration**: OrchestrationManager singleton coordinates all handle operations

#### Technical Implementation
```rust
// BEFORE: Global Lookup Pattern (‚ùå Problematic)
Ruby Call ‚Üí Direct FFI ‚Üí Global Lookup ‚Üí New Resource Creation ‚Üí Operation

// AFTER: Handle-Based Pattern (‚úÖ Optimal)
Ruby Call ‚Üí OrchestrationManager ‚Üí Handle ‚Üí Persistent Resources ‚Üí Operation

// Handle Creation (ONE TIME)
let handle = OrchestrationHandle::new()?; // Creates persistent Arc references

// All Operations Use Handle (ZERO GLOBAL LOOKUPS)
handle.create_test_task(options)?;        // Uses handle.testing_factory
handle.register_ffi_handler(data)?;       // Uses handle.orchestration_system
```

#### Integration Points
- **OrchestrationHandle**: `src/handles.rs` with handle-based factory and orchestration operations
- **OrchestrationManager**: Ruby singleton managing handle lifecycle and all FFI delegation
- **Handle Creation**: `TaskerCore.create_orchestration_handle` creates persistent handle instances
- **Ruby Operations**: All factory and orchestration operations use `_with_handle` methods

#### Validation Results
- ‚úÖ **Handle Creation**: OrchestrationHandle creates successfully with persistent references
- ‚úÖ **Zero Global Lookups**: All operations use handle's internal references after creation
- ‚úÖ **Performance Validated**: Handle operations show no pool timeout symptoms
- ‚úÖ **Ruby Integration**: OrchestrationManager.instance.orchestration_handle working correctly
- ‚úÖ **Architecture Pattern**: Demonstrates proper FFI optimization approach

## Code Design Principles

- **No More Placeholders**: All new code must be implemented to completion [[memory:3255552]]
- **Testing-Driven**: Use failing tests to expose and fix existing placeholders
- **Sequential Progress**: Complete current phase before proceeding to next
- **Proper Integration**: All code must delegate properly to Rust core system [[memory:3255552]]
- Use TODO for intentionally delayed future work, but not to sidestep a better pattern

## Testing Guidelines

- As much as possible, tests should go in our tests/ directory, excluding doctests
- Use sqlx::test for tests requiring database access
- Use #[test] on its own for pure unit tests
- **Integration Tests Priority**: Complex workflows reveal system boundaries and force placeholder completion
- **Doctest Excellence**: Maintain high doctest success rate with working examples

## MCP Server Integration

**Essential Development Tools**: This project uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to enhance development workflow and capabilities.

### Configured MCP Servers

## Latest Session Summary (January 2025) - Database Pool Issue Resolution

### What We Accomplished
1. **Database Pool Audit**: Systematic identification of all database pool creation instances across Ruby bindings
2. **Performance.rs Fixes**: Updated `get_analytics_metrics` and `analyze_dependencies` functions to use shared global pool
3. **Factory Wrappers Fixes**: Updated all 3 factory wrapper functions to use `crate::globals::execute_async()` and shared pool
4. **Runtime Precedence Pattern**: Applied consistent runtime management to avoid nested runtime conflicts
5. **Architecture Cleanup**: Removed 5+ separate `PgPool::connect()` calls that were causing connection exhaustion

### Critical Issue Identified
- **Database Pool Exhaustion**: Multiple components creating separate database pools instead of using singleton
- **Root Cause**: Factory functions and SQL functions creating independent pools, exhausting connection limits
- **Test Impact**: Pool timeout errors preventing proper Ruby-Rust integration validation

### Files Modified This Session
- `bindings/ruby/ext/tasker_core/src/performance.rs`: Fixed 2 functions to use shared pool
- `bindings/ruby/ext/tasker_core/src/test_helpers/factory_wrappers.rs`: Fixed 3 functions to use runtime precedence
- `bindings/ruby/ext/tasker_core/src/globals.rs`: Enhanced understanding of pool management architecture

### Outstanding Issues (Continuing Next Session)
1. **Persistent Pool Timeouts**: Despite fixes, pool exhaustion errors continue in tests
2. **Potential Remaining Sources**: User identified `models/ruby_step_sequence.rs` may contain additional pool creation
3. **Orchestration System Timing**: Possible race condition in global orchestration system initialization
4. **Step Handler Task ID**: Final test failure related to task_id extraction (blocked by pool issues)

### Next Session Priorities
1. **Complete Pool Audit**: Search for any remaining `PgPool::connect()` or pool creation patterns
2. **Validate Singleton Pattern**: Ensure global orchestration system initialization is working correctly
3. **Test Pool Behavior**: Debug why shared pool still shows timeout symptoms
4. **Move Globals Pattern**: Consider moving globals.rs to core FFI module for reuse across language bindings

### Current Test Status
- **Before**: Many timeout failures, completely broken integration
- **After Fixes**: 69 examples, 3 failures (significant improvement but pool timeouts persist)
- **Target**: All pool timeouts resolved, only semantic test failures remaining
