# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**tasker-core-rs** is a high-performance Rust implementation of the core workflow orchestration engine, designed to complement the existing Ruby on Rails **Tasker** engine found at `/Users/petetaylor/projects/tasker/`. This project leverages Rust's memory safety, fearless parallelism, and performance characteristics to handle computationally intensive workflow orchestration, dependency resolution, and state management operations.

**Architecture**: Step handler foundation where Rust implements the complete step handler base class that frameworks (Rails, Python, Node.js) extend through subclassing with `process()` and `process_results()` hooks.

## MCP Server Integration

**Essential Development Tools**: This project uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to enhance development workflow and capabilities.

### Configured MCP Servers
- **PostgreSQL MCP** (`crystaldba/postgres-mcp`): Database operations, performance analysis, and migration management
- **GitHub Official MCP** (`github/github-mcp-server`): Repository operations, PR management, and CI/CD integration  
- **Cargo Package MCP** (`artmann/package-registry-mcp`): Rust dependency management and security analysis
- **Docker MCP** (`docker/mcp-servers`): Containerized testing and deployment automation
- **Rust Documentation MCP** (`Govcraft/rust-docs-mcp-server`): Real-time Rust best practices and API guidance
- **Context7 MCP** (SSE): Enhanced development context and intelligence
- **Tasker MCP** (Added July 2025): We now have access to all of the mcp servers in .mcp.json and should use them

**Configuration**: See `docs/MCP_TOOLS.md` for detailed setup, capabilities, and integration patterns.

**Benefits**: Enhanced database development, automated dependency management, streamlined CI/CD workflows, and real-time Rust guidance.
