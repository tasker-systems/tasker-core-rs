# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**tasker-core-rs** is a high-performance Rust implementation of the core workflow orchestration engine, designed to complement the existing Ruby on Rails **Tasker** engine found at `/Users/petetaylor/projects/tasker-systems/tasker-engine/`. This project leverages Rust's memory safety, fearless parallelism, and performance characteristics to handle computationally intensive workflow orchestration, dependency resolution, and state management operations.

**Architecture**: Delegation-based pattern where Rust implements the complete orchestration core that frameworks (Rails, Python, Node.js) extend through FFI integration with `process()` and `process_results()` hooks.

## Development Roadmap - Source of Truth

**ALWAYS REFER TO**: `docs/roadmap/README.md` as the authoritative source for:
- Current development phase and priorities
- Weekly milestones and success criteria
- Critical placeholder analysis and resolution strategy
- Implementation guidelines and code quality standards

**Current Status**: Phase 3 (Ruby Integration Testing) - Week 3 - TaskConfigFinder Complete
- **Goal**: Complete validation of Ruby-Rust integration and prepare for production use
- **Focus**: End-to-end Ruby step handler testing, database integration, performance validation
- **Recent Achievement**: âœ… TaskConfigFinder implementation complete with registry and file system fallback
- **Rule**: Ensure Ruby step handlers work seamlessly with Rust orchestration core

## Recent Major Achievement: TaskConfigFinder Implementation

### âœ… TaskConfigFinder Complete (January 2025)
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE** - Centralized task configuration discovery with registry integration
**Impact**: Eliminated hardcoded configuration paths and enabled Ruby handler configuration registration

#### Key Features Implemented
- **Registry-First Search**: Checks TaskHandlerRegistry for registered configurations before file system
- **File System Fallback**: Searches multiple paths with versioned and default naming patterns
- **Path Resolution**: Uses configurable `task_config_directory` from `tasker-config.yaml`
- **Type Conversion**: Seamless conversion between config and model TaskTemplate types
- **Ruby Integration**: Enables Ruby handlers to register configurations directly in registry

#### Technical Implementation
```rust
// Search Strategy: Registry â†’ File System
pub async fn find_task_template(
    &self,
    namespace: &str,
    name: &str,
    version: &str,
) -> OrchestrationResult<TaskTemplate>

// Path Patterns:
// 1. <config_dir>/tasks/{namespace}/{name}/{version}.(yml|yaml)
// 2. <config_dir>/tasks/{name}/{version}.(yml|yaml)
// 3. <config_dir>/tasks/{name}.(yml|yaml)
```

#### Integration Points
- **StepExecutor**: Now uses TaskConfigFinder instead of hardcoded paths
- **WorkflowCoordinator**: Creates and injects TaskConfigFinder into StepExecutor
- **TaskHandlerRegistry**: Enhanced with TaskTemplate storage and retrieval
- **Ruby Handlers**: Can register configurations directly in registry

#### Test Coverage
- âœ… **553 total tests passing** (92 unit + 86 integration + 199 comprehensive + 63 doctests + more)
- âœ… **TaskConfigFinder demo** working with registry and file system examples
- âœ… **Ruby bindings** still compile correctly after changes
- âœ… **All git hooks** passing including doctest compilation

## Code Design Principles

- **No More Placeholders**: All new code must be implemented to completion [[memory:3255552]]
- **Testing-Driven**: Use failing tests to expose and fix existing placeholders
- **Sequential Progress**: Complete current phase before proceeding to next
- **Proper Integration**: All code must delegate properly to Rust core system [[memory:3255552]]
- Use TODO for intentionally delayed future work, but not to sidestep a better pattern

## Testing Guidelines

- As much as possible, tests should go in our tests/ directory, excluding doctests
- Use sqlx::test for tests requiring database access
- Use #[test] on its own for pure unit tests
- **Integration Tests Priority**: Complex workflows reveal system boundaries and force placeholder completion
- **Doctest Excellence**: Maintain high doctest success rate with working examples

## MCP Server Integration

**Essential Development Tools**: This project uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to enhance development workflow and capabilities.

### Configured MCP Servers
- **PostgreSQL MCP** (`crystaldba/postgres-mcp`): Database operations, performance analysis, and migration management
- **GitHub Official MCP** (`github/github-mcp-server`): Repository operations, PR management, and CI/CD integration
- **Cargo Package MCP** (`artmann/package-registry-mcp`): Rust dependency management and security analysis
- **Docker MCP** (`docker/mcp-servers`): Containerized testing and deployment automation
- **Rust Documentation MCP** (`Govcraft/rust-docs-mcp-server`): Real-time Rust best practices and API guidance
- **Context7 MCP** (SSE): Enhanced development context and intelligence
- **Tasker MCP** (Added July 2025): We now have access to all of the mcp servers in .mcp.json and should use them

**Configuration**: See `docs/MCP_TOOLS.md` for detailed setup, capabilities, and integration patterns.

**Benefits**: Enhanced database development, automated dependency management, streamlined CI/CD workflows, and real-time Rust guidance.

## Current Development Context (January 2025)

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Ruby FFI Mitigation Crisis
**URGENT PRIORITY**: Prior session accidentally destroyed working Ruby FFI implementation before git commit
**CURRENT STATUS**: Ruby bindings contain incorrect re-implementations instead of proper FFI bridges
**IMPACT**: Complete breakdown of Ruby-Rust integration - bindings don't use core logic

#### What Happened
- Previous session had working Ruby FFI bridges that properly delegated to core Rust logic
- Session ended before committing working implementation to git
- Subsequent session accidentally overwrote working code with incorrect re-implementations
- Current bindings violate delegation architecture by reimplementing core logic

#### Critical Issues in Current Codebase
1. **Handler Violations**: `bindings/ruby/ext/tasker_core/src/handlers/base_step_handler.rs` and `base_task_handler.rs` incorrectly re-implement logic from `src/orchestration/step_handler.rs` and `src/orchestration/task_handler.rs`
2. **Event System Duplication**: `bindings/ruby/ext/tasker_core/src/events/` completely reimplements `src/events/publisher.rs` and `src/events/types.rs` instead of bridging to them
3. **Architecture Violations**: Ruby bindings create new database connections, runtime instances, and orchestration components per FFI call instead of using singleton patterns
4. **Performance Impact**: Each FFI call recreates expensive resources, violating the delegation architecture's performance goals

#### Recovery Strategy
- **Phase 3 PAUSED**: Enhanced event integration postponed until FFI foundation is restored
- **NEW PRIORITY**: Ruby FFI Mitigation Plan (documented in `docs/roadmap/ruby-ffi-mitigation-plan.md`)
- **APPROACH**: Remove incorrect implementations, create proper FFI bridges that delegate to core logic
- **TIMELINE**: 1-2 sessions to restore working Ruby integration before resuming Phase 3

### Testing-Driven Development Success ðŸŽ¯
**Approach**: Using comprehensive integration tests to systematically expose and fix critical placeholders
**Philosophy**: Test failures are documentation - they show us exactly what needs to be implemented
**Results**: Methodical identification and resolution of system-breaking issues
