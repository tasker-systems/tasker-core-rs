# TaskTemplate Configuration - Ruby Implementation
#
# Microservices Namespace: User Registration Workflow
# Demonstrates microservices coordination with parallel execution
#
# Template: microservices/user_registration:1.0.0
# Implementation: Ruby FFI with tasker-worker-rb
# Blog Post: Post 03 - Microservices Coordination
#
# Business Workflow Pattern (5 steps):
# Microservices Coordination - Sequential + Parallel Execution
#
# Sequential Phase (1 step):
# 1. Create User Account: Create user in user service (with idempotency)
#
# Parallel Phase (2 steps):
# 2. Setup Billing Profile: Create billing profile in billing service
# 3. Initialize Preferences: Set user preferences in preferences service
#
# Coordination Phase (1 step):
# 4. Send Welcome Sequence: Send welcome emails via notification service (depends on billing + preferences)
#
# Completion Phase (1 step):
# 5. Update User Status: Mark user as active in user service (final step)
#
# This demonstrates parallel execution, dependency resolution, and multi-service coordination
# using Tasker's built-in retry system as a circuit breaker pattern.
