# TaskTemplate Configuration - Ruby Implementation with Decision Points
#
# Conditional Approval Workflow with TAS-53 Decision Point Routing
# Demonstrates dynamic workflow step creation based on runtime conditions
#
# Template: conditional_approval/approval_routing:1.0.0
# Implementation: Ruby FFI with decision point support
# Feature: TAS-53 Dynamic Workflows & DecisionPoint Steps
#
# Workflow Pattern:
# 1. validate_request: Validate approval request data
# 2. routing_decision: DECISION POINT - route based on amount
#    - Creates different approval steps dynamically:
#      * < $1,000: auto_approve
#      * $1,000-$4,999: manager_approval
#      * >= $5,000: manager_approval + finance_review
# 3. Dynamic Steps (created by decision point):
#    - auto_approve: Auto-approval for small amounts
#    - manager_approval: Manager review
#    - finance_review: Finance review for large amounts
# 4. finalize_approval: Convergence step processing all approvals

  # DYNAMICALLY CREATED STEP DEFINITIONS
  # These steps are NOT created at task initialization.
  # They are created at runtime when the routing_decision step executes
  # and returns a DecisionPointOutcome with step names.
  #
  # The WorkflowGraph segmentation logic identifies these as descendants
  # of the decision point (routing_decision) and excludes them from
  # initial_step_set(). They will be created dynamically when the
  # decision point executes and specifies which steps to create.
