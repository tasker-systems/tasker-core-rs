# TaskTemplate Configuration - Rust Implementation
#
# Payments Namespace: Process Refund Workflow
# Demonstrates namespace isolation with same workflow name in different namespaces
#
# Template: payments/process_refund:1.0.0
# Implementation: Native Rust with tasker-worker-rust
# Blog Post: Post 04 - Team Scaling (Namespace Isolation)
#
# Business Workflow Pattern (4 steps):
# 1. Validate Payment Eligibility: Check if payment can be refunded via gateway
# 2. Process Gateway Refund: Execute refund through payment processor
# 3. Update Payment Records: Update internal payment status and history
# 4. Notify Customer: Send refund confirmation to customer
#
# This demonstrates the payments team's direct refund workflow
