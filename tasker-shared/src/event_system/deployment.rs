//! # Deployment Mode Management for Event-Driven Systems
//!
//! This module provides shared deployment mode concepts that can be used across
//! both orchestration and worker contexts for managing event-driven patterns.
//!
//! ## Deployment Modes
//!
//! - **PollingOnly**: Traditional polling-based approach (maximum reliability)
//! - **Hybrid**: Event-driven with polling fallback (optimal balance)
//! - **EventDrivenOnly**: Pure event-driven approach (maximum performance)
//!
//! ## Key Design Principles
//!
//! - **Permanent Fallback**: Polling is not a migration tool but a reliability feature
//! - **Configuration-Driven**: All behavior controlled via TOML configuration
//! - **Context Agnostic**: Same patterns work for orchestration and worker systems
//! - **Health Monitoring**: Built-in rollback detection and automatic fallback
