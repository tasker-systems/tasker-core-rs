# Event System Analysis and Roadmap

This document analyzes the Rails engine event system architecture and outlines the roadmap for enhanced Rust-Ruby event integration.

## Current Status

### Phase 2 Accomplishments ‚úÖ
- **FFI Event Bridge**: Implemented basic Rust‚ÜíRuby event forwarding with callback registration
- **Configuration Management**: Extracted hardcoded values to YAML configuration
- **Event Publishing Core**: Unified event system with dual API (simple + structured)
- **External Callback System**: Registry for cross-language event handlers

### Rails Engine Event System Analysis

#### Architecture Overview
The Rails engine uses a sophisticated event system built on dry-events with the following components:

**Core Infrastructure:**
- **Publisher Singleton**: `Tasker::Events::Publisher` using dry-events with automatic event registration
- **BaseSubscriber Pattern**: Declarative subscription system with automatic method routing
- **Event Constants**: Statically defined events in `Tasker::Constants` (56+ events)
- **Custom Event Registry**: Dynamic registration system for business-specific events
- **Event Catalog**: Complete searchable registry of system + custom events

**Key Design Patterns:**
1. **Singleton Publisher**: Single source of truth for event publishing
2. **Declarative Subscriptions**: `subscribe_to :task_completed, :step_failed` class method pattern
3. **Automatic Method Routing**: Event names map to handler methods (`task.completed` ‚Üí `handle_task_completed`)
4. **Dual Event Types**: System events (constants) + custom events (dynamic registration)
5. **Safe Payload Access**: Defensive event handling with fallback values

#### Event Categories

**System Events (56+ events):**
- Task Events: `task.completed`, `task.failed`, `task.initialize_requested`
- Step Events: `step.completed`, `step.failed`, `step.execution_requested`
- Workflow Events: `workflow.started`, `workflow.completed`
- Observability Events: Task/Step monitoring and telemetry

**Custom Events (Dynamic):**
- Business-specific: `order.fulfilled`, `payment.processed`, `inventory.restock_needed`
- Auto-discovery: Events defined in handler classes or YAML templates
- Namespace support: `custom.order.processed` format

#### Observability Strategy

**Dual Approach:**
1. **Telemetry (TelemetrySubscriber)**: OpenTelemetry spans for detailed debugging
2. **Metrics (MetricsSubscriber)**: Aggregated data for dashboards/alerts

**TelemetrySubscriber Features:**
- Hierarchical span relationships (task ‚Üí step spans)
- Automatic duration calculation with fallbacks
- Error status propagation with categorization
- Service-prefixed attributes for multi-service environments
- Sensitive data filtering with configurable parameter filters

**Integration Examples:**
- Slack notifications for critical failures
- PagerDuty alerts for system errors
- StatsD metrics for operational monitoring
- Custom business event workflows

## Gap Analysis: Rust vs Rails Integration

### Current Limitations

1. **One-Way Event Flow**: Rust can forward to Ruby, but Ruby cannot easily publish back to Rust
2. **Payload Structure Mismatch**: Rust uses simple JSON, Rails expects specific payload schemas
3. **Event Type Mapping**: No mapping between Rust event names and Rails constants
4. **Custom Event Registration**: Rust cannot register events in Rails CustomRegistry
5. **BaseSubscriber Incompatibility**: Rust events don't follow Rails subscription patterns

### Missing Features

1. **Bidirectional Event Flow**: Ruby ‚Üí Rust event publishing capability
2. **Event Type Constants**: Shared constants between Rust and Rails
3. **Payload Standardization**: Compatible payload structures across languages
4. **Custom Event Bridge**: Registration of Rust custom events in Rails registry
5. **Subscription Bridge**: Rust handlers subscribing to Rails events

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 3: Enhanced Event Integration (Current)

#### 3.1 FFI Publishing Bridge ‚≠ê **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Goal**: Enable Rust to publish directly to Rails dry-events Publisher singleton

**Implementation:**
```rust
// New FFI function in handlers.rs
pub fn rust_publish_to_rails(event_name: String, payload: Value) -> Result<Value, Error>
```

**Ruby Integration:**
```ruby
def self.handle_rust_event_publication(event_name, payload)
  Tasker::Events::Publisher.instance.publish(event_name, payload)
end
```

**Benefits:**
- Rust orchestration events appear natively in Rails
- Existing Rails subscribers automatically receive Rust events
- No changes needed to existing Rails event handling code

#### 3.2 Payload Serialization Compatibility ‚≠ê **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Goal**: Standardize payload structures between Rust and Rails

**Rails Payload Structure:**
```ruby
{
  task_id: "123",
  step_id: "456", 
  timestamp: Time.current,
  task_name: "order_processor",
  step_name: "validate_payment",
  # ... event-specific fields
}
```

**Rust Implementation:**
```rust
pub struct RailsCompatiblePayload {
    task_id: Option<String>,
    step_id: Option<String>, 
    timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    task_name: Option<String>,
    step_name: Option<String>,
    // ... additional fields
}
```

#### 3.3 Event Type Mapping üî∂ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Goal**: Map Rust event names to Rails constants for consistency

**Mapping Structure:**
```rust
pub static RAILS_EVENT_MAPPING: &[(&str, &str)] = &[
    ("task.completed", "Tasker::Constants::TaskEvents::COMPLETED"),
    ("step.failed", "Tasker::Constants::StepEvents::FAILED"),
    // ... complete mapping
];
```

**Auto-Resolution:**
```rust
fn resolve_rails_event_constant(rust_event_name: &str) -> Option<&str>
```

#### 3.4 Custom Event Registration Bridge üî∂ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Goal**: Register Rust custom events in Rails CustomRegistry

**FFI Interface:**
```rust
pub fn register_custom_event_in_rails(
    event_name: String,
    description: String, 
    fired_by: Vec<String>
) -> Result<Value, Error>
```

**Rails Integration:**
```ruby
def self.register_rust_custom_event(event_name, description, fired_by)
  Tasker::Events::CustomRegistry.instance.register_event(
    event_name,
    description: description,
    fired_by: fired_by
  )
end
```

### Phase 4: Bidirectional Integration

#### 4.1 Ruby‚ÜíRust Event Publishing
**Goal**: Enable Rails to publish events that Rust can handle

#### 4.2 Rust Event Subscription System  
**Goal**: Rust handlers can subscribe to Rails events

#### 4.3 Event Middleware Integration
**Goal**: Leverage dry-events middleware for filtering, routing, batching

### Phase 5: Advanced Features

#### 5.1 Event Pattern Matching
**Goal**: Use dry-events pattern matching for complex event routing

#### 5.2 Event Batching and Buffering
**Goal**: Optimize cross-language event performance

#### 5.3 Event Replay and Recovery
**Goal**: Event sourcing capabilities for workflow recovery

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 3 Sprint Plan (2 weeks)

**Week 1: Core Publishing Bridge**
- Day 1-2: Implement `rust_publish_to_rails` FFI function
- Day 3-4: Create payload serialization compatibility layer
- Day 5: Integration testing with existing Rails subscribers

**Week 2: Event Type Integration**
- Day 1-2: Implement event type mapping system
- Day 3-4: Add custom event registration bridge
- Day 5: Complete integration testing and documentation

### Success Criteria

**Phase 3 Completion:**
1. ‚úÖ Rust can publish events that appear natively in Rails dry-events
2. ‚úÖ Payload structures are compatible between languages
3. ‚úÖ Event type mapping works bidirectionally
4. ‚úÖ Rust custom events register in Rails CustomRegistry
5. ‚úÖ All existing Rails subscribers receive Rust events seamlessly
6. ‚úÖ Integration tests verify end-to-end event flow

**Performance Targets:**
- <1ms FFI overhead per event publication
- >1000 events/sec cross-language throughput
- Zero event loss during FFI transitions

## Technical Considerations

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when Rails event system unavailable
- Detailed error reporting for FFI boundary issues
- Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures

### Thread Safety
- All FFI event operations must be thread-safe
- Rust async event publishing compatible with Ruby threading
- No deadlocks in bidirectional event scenarios

- Error injection tests for resilience verification

## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing Rails event functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to current event handlers
- Optional feature flags for new Rust integration features

### Rollout Plan
1. **Internal Testing**: Verify integration with test events
2. **Shadow Mode**: Publish Rust events alongside existing Rails events
3. **Gradual Migration**: Move specific event types to Rust publishing
4. **Full Integration**: Complete Rust-Rails event unification
