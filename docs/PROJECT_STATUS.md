# Tasker Core Rust - Project Status

## Last Updated: 2025-07-01

> **ðŸš¨ ARCHITECTURE REVISION**: After deep analysis of Rails orchestration patterns, we've revised our approach from a monolithic replacement to a **delegation-based orchestration core**. See `docs/ORCHESTRATION_ANALYSIS.md` and `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN_REVISED.md` for the new architecture.

### What We've Accomplished

1. **Project Analysis & Planning**
   - Thoroughly reviewed the Rails Tasker engine at `/Users/petetaylor/projects/tasker/`
   - Analyzed the vision, architecture, database schema, and core components
   - Identified performance-critical components for Rust implementation
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive project context

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Updated Rust toolchain to latest version (1.88.0)
   - Configured MCP servers in `.mcp.json`:
     - postgres, github, filesystem, memory, docker, openapi, prometheus
     - brave-search, puppeteer, sequential-thinking
   - Installed necessary MCP server packages

3. **Project Structure Created**
   - Initialized Rust library project with `cargo init --lib`
   - Created complete directory structure:
     ```
     src/
     â”œâ”€â”€ models/          # Database entities (Task, WorkflowStep, etc.)
     â”œâ”€â”€ orchestration/   # Core engine (Coordinator, StepExecutor, etc.)
     â”œâ”€â”€ state_machine/   # State management (TaskStateMachine, StepStateMachine)
     â”œâ”€â”€ events/          # Event system (Publisher, Subscriber, LifecycleEvents)
     â”œâ”€â”€ registry/        # Registry systems (HandlerFactory, PluginRegistry, etc.)
     â”œâ”€â”€ database/        # Database layer (Connection, Migrations)
     â”œâ”€â”€ ffi/            # Foreign Function Interface (Ruby, Python, C API)
     â”œâ”€â”€ error.rs        # Error handling types
     â””â”€â”€ config.rs       # Configuration management
     ```

4. **Dependencies Configured**
   - Async runtime: tokio with full features
   - Database: sqlx with PostgreSQL support
   - Serialization: serde, serde_json
   - Error handling: thiserror, anyhow
   - Observability: tracing, OpenTelemetry
   - Concurrency: parking_lot, dashmap, crossbeam
   - FFI: magnus (Ruby), pyo3 (Python)
   - Testing: criterion for benchmarks

5. **SQLx Database Layer Complete** ðŸŽ‰
   - SQLx CLI installed and configured
   - Database schema migrated from Rails structure.sql
   - All 9 core Tasker tables created with proper relationships
   - Database connection module implemented and tested
   - Type-safe queries with compile-time verification working
   - Comprehensive test suite passing

6. **Development Planning Complete**
   - Created detailed 5-phase development roadmap
   - Documented architectural decisions and rationale
   - Established performance targets and success criteria
   - Identified dependencies between components

### Current Status: Ready for Phase 1 Implementation

**Next Immediate Priority**: Database Models Implementation (Phase 1 of 5)

### 5-Phase Development Plan

#### **Phase 1: Foundation Layer** (1-2 weeks)
- Database models (structs mapping to tables)
- Repository pattern for complex queries  
- Performance-optimized dependency resolution queries
- Comprehensive test coverage and benchmarks

#### **Phase 2: State Management** (1-2 weeks)  
- TaskStateMachine with atomic transitions
- StepStateMachine with retry logic
- State validation and audit trails
- Thread-safe concurrent operations

#### **Phase 3: Orchestration Engine** (2-3 weeks)
- ViableStepDiscovery (10-100x faster dependency resolution)
- StepExecutor (concurrent step execution)
- Coordinator (system orchestration)
- BackoffCalculator (intelligent retry logic)

#### **Phase 4: Event System** (1-2 weeks)
- 56+ lifecycle event definitions
- High-throughput event publisher (>10k events/sec)
- Subscriber registry with type-safe routing
- Event persistence and replay capabilities

#### **Phase 5: Integration Layer** (1-2 weeks)
- Ruby bindings via magnus for Rails integration
- Python bindings via PyO3 for data science
- C-compatible API for maximum interoperability
- Performance benchmarking and optimization

### Key Design Decisions

- **Async-first**: Using Tokio for all async operations
- **Type-safe SQL**: SQLx for compile-time verified queries
- **Performance**: Targeting 10-100x improvement in dependency resolution
- **Memory Safety**: Leveraging Rust's ownership system
- **Interoperability**: Supporting Ruby, Python, and C FFI

### Database Configuration

- Connection string: `postgresql://tasker:tasker@localhost/tasker_rust_development`
- Using the same schema as Rails Tasker engine
- Will implement migrations to ensure compatibility

### Rails Tasker Reference

The Ruby on Rails engine is located at `/Users/petetaylor/projects/tasker/` and provides:
- Complete workflow orchestration implementation
- Database schema in `spec/dummy/db/structure.sql`
- Core logic in `lib/tasker/` directory
- Models in `app/models/` directory

This Rust implementation will complement the Rails engine by providing high-performance orchestration while the Rails engine continues to provide the web interface and developer ergonomics.
