# TAS-54 Solution Proposal: Audit-Only Processor UUID Approach

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Proposed
**Author**: Claude Code (based on comprehensive idempotency audit)

## Executive Summary

### The Problem

When orchestrators crash with tasks in active processing states (`Initializing`, `EnqueuingSteps`, `EvaluatingResults`), the processor UUID ownership enforcement prevents new orchestrators from taking over the work. Tasks become permanently stuck until manual intervention.

### Root Cause Identified

**Location**: `tasker-shared/src/state_machine/task_state_machine.rs:125-131`

```rust
if target_state.requires_ownership() {
    let current_processor = self.get_current_processor().await?;
    TransitionGuard::check_ownership(target_state, current_processor, self.processor_uuid)
        .map_err(|e| StateMachineError::GuardFailed {
            reason: e.to_string(),
        })?;
}
```

**The Issue**: Three states require ownership enforcement:
- `Initializing` (TaskRequestActor)
- `EnqueuingSteps` (StepEnqueuerActor)
- `EvaluatingResults` (ResultProcessorActor) ‚Üê **Primary failure point**

When orchestrator A crashes in `EvaluatingResults`, orchestrator B cannot process step results because ownership check fails: `B != A`.

### Proposed Solution

**Move to audit-only processor UUID tracking**:
1. ‚úÖ **Keep** processor UUID in all transitions (audit trail for debugging)
2. ‚ùå **Remove** ownership enforcement from state transitions
3. ‚úÖ **Rely on** existing state machine guards for idempotency
4. üîß **Add** configuration flag for gradual rollout
5. üìä **Monitor** for any race conditions in production

### Evidence of Safety

**Phase 1.1 Audit (TaskRequestActor)**: Already operates with audit-only processor UUID
- Transaction atomicity prevents duplicate writes
- `identity_hash` unique constraint prevents duplicate tasks
- State machine has current-state guards
- **Verdict**: ‚úÖ Fully idempotent without ownership enforcement

**Phase 1.2 Audit (ResultProcessorActor)**: Has built-in idempotency guards
- StateTransitionHandler checks current state before processing
- TaskCoordinator checks state before transitioning
- State machine transitions are atomic
- **Verdict**: ‚úÖ Would be idempotent without ownership enforcement

### User Context

> "Task orchestration runs no business logic, each step is handled idempotently, and so even race conditions around steps being finished in parallel should not result in inconsistent task states"

**Risk Tolerance**: High - willing to remove ownership if idempotency audit passes

---

## Detailed Root Cause Analysis

### Ownership Enforcement Chain

1. **TaskStateMachine.transition()** (`task_state_machine.rs:112`)
   - Checks if target state `requires_ownership()`
   - Calls `TransitionGuard::check_ownership()`

2. **TaskState.requires_ownership()** (`states.rs:56`)
   ```rust
   pub fn requires_ownership(&self) -> bool {
       matches!(
           self,
           TaskState::Initializing |
           TaskState::EnqueuingSteps |
           TaskState::EvaluatingResults
       )
   }
   ```

3. **TransitionGuard::check_ownership()** (`guards.rs:97-113`)
   ```rust
   match task_processor {
       Some(owner) if owner == requesting_processor => Ok(()),
       Some(owner) => Err(business_rule_violation(format!(
           "Processor {} does not own task in state {:?} (owned by {})",
           requesting_processor, state, owner
       ))),
       None => Ok(()), // No owner yet, can claim
   }
   ```

### The Failure Scenario

**Real-world timeline from logs** (analyzing `analysis.md`):

```
2025-09-01T00:37:59.123Z: Orchestrator A processes step result
2025-09-01T00:37:59.145Z: Task transitions to EvaluatingResults (owner: A)
2025-09-01T00:37:59.167Z: Orchestrator A crashes (pod killed)
2025-09-01T00:38:14.234Z: Orchestrator B starts up
2025-09-01T00:38:14.567Z: B receives retry of step result message
2025-09-01T00:38:14.589Z: B attempts to process task
2025-09-01T00:38:14.612Z: ERROR: Ownership check fails (B != A)
2025-09-01T00:38:14.623Z: Task stuck in EvaluatingResults
```

**Key Observation**: 15-second gap between crash and retry, but task permanently blocked.

### Why Ownership Was Originally Added (TAS-41)

**Historical Context**: Introduced to prevent race conditions in distributed orchestration

**Original Intent**:
- Prevent two orchestrators from processing same task simultaneously
- Ensure coordination consistency during active processing
- Track which orchestrator is responsible for work

**What Changed Since TAS-41**:
- **TAS-37**: Atomic finalization claiming via SQL functions
- **TAS-40**: Command pattern with stateless async processors
- **TAS-46**: Actor pattern with 4 production-ready actors
- **Architecture Evolution**: Layers of idempotency protection added

**Verdict**: Original problem (race conditions) is now solved by multiple other mechanisms. Ownership enforcement has become a liability.

---

## Proposed Solution: Audit-Only Approach

### Core Changes

#### 1. Remove Ownership Enforcement from State Machine

**File**: `tasker-shared/src/state_machine/task_state_machine.rs`

**Current Code** (lines 124-132):
```rust
// Check ownership if required (TAS-41 processor ownership)
if target_state.requires_ownership() {
    let current_processor = self.get_current_processor().await?;
    TransitionGuard::check_ownership(target_state, current_processor, self.processor_uuid)
        .map_err(|e| StateMachineError::GuardFailed {
            reason: e.to_string(),
        })?;
}
```

**Proposed Code** (with configuration flag):
```rust
// TAS-54: Optional ownership enforcement (audit-only mode)
if self.enforce_ownership && target_state.requires_ownership() {
    let current_processor = self.get_current_processor().await?;
    TransitionGuard::check_ownership(target_state, current_processor, self.processor_uuid)
        .map_err(|e| StateMachineError::GuardFailed {
            reason: e.to_string(),
        })?;
}
```

#### 2. Add Configuration Flag

**File**: `tasker-shared/src/config/engine.rs`

```toml
[engine]
# TAS-54: Processor ownership enforcement
# - true: Enforce ownership (TAS-41 behavior, blocks stale tasks)
# - false: Audit-only (TAS-54 behavior, allows recovery)
enforce_processor_ownership = false
```

**Rust Config**:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct EngineConfig {
    // ... existing fields ...

    /// TAS-54: Enable processor ownership enforcement
    ///
    /// When true, state transitions requiring ownership will fail if
    /// attempted by a different processor than the current owner.
    ///
    /// When false, processor UUID is still tracked for audit purposes,
    /// but ownership checks are bypassed, allowing task recovery after
    /// orchestrator crashes.
    ///
    /// Default: false (audit-only mode)
    #[serde(default = "default_enforce_ownership")]
    pub enforce_processor_ownership: bool,
}

fn default_enforce_ownership() -> bool {
    false // TAS-54: Default to audit-only
}
```

#### 3. Preserve Audit Trail

**No changes to transition persistence** - processor UUID continues to be stored:

**File**: `tasker-shared/src/state_machine/persistence.rs` (UNCHANGED)

```rust
pub async fn transition_with_ownership(
    &self,
    task_uuid: Uuid,
    from_state: TaskState,
    to_state: TaskState,
    processor_uuid: Uuid,  // ‚Üê Still stored for audit
    metadata: Option<Value>,
    pool: &PgPool,
) -> PersistenceResult<bool> {
    let new_transition = NewTaskTransition {
        task_uuid,
        to_state: to_state.to_string(),
        from_state: Some(from_state.to_string()),
        processor_uuid: Some(processor_uuid), // ‚Üê Audit trail maintained
        metadata: Some(transition_metadata),
    };

    TaskTransition::create(pool, new_transition).await?;
    Ok(true)
}
```

**Benefit**: Full debugging capability retained, only enforcement removed.

#### 4. Update TaskStateMachine Constructor

**File**: `tasker-shared/src/state_machine/task_state_machine.rs`

```rust
pub struct TaskStateMachine {
    task_uuid: Uuid,
    task: Task,
    current_state: TaskState,
    pool: PgPool,
    event_publisher: Arc<EventPublisher>,
    persistence: TaskTransitionPersistence,
    processor_uuid: Uuid,
    enforce_ownership: bool, // ‚Üê New field from config
}

impl TaskStateMachine {
    pub async fn for_task(
        task_uuid: Uuid,
        pool: PgPool,
        processor_uuid: Uuid,
        enforce_ownership: bool, // ‚Üê New parameter
    ) -> StateMachineResult<Self> {
        // ... existing code ...
        Ok(Self {
            task_uuid,
            task,
            current_state,
            pool,
            event_publisher,
            persistence,
            processor_uuid,
            enforce_ownership, // ‚Üê Store from config
        })
    }
}
```

### Idempotency Guarantees Without Ownership

#### TaskRequestActor (Task Initialization)

**Protection Mechanisms**:
1. ‚úÖ **Transaction Atomicity**: All writes in single transaction
2. ‚úÖ **Unique Constraints**: `identity_hash` prevents duplicate tasks
3. ‚úÖ **Find-or-Create**: Namespaces use atomic pattern
4. ‚úÖ **State Guards**: Current state checks before transitions

**Race Condition Analysis**:
```
Orchestrator A and B both receive TaskRequestMessage for same task:
T0: A begins transaction
T0: B begins transaction
T1: A computes identity_hash = "abc123"
T1: B computes identity_hash = "abc123" (deterministic)
T2: A inserts task successfully
T2: B attempts insert
T3: B fails with unique constraint violation on identity_hash
T3: B's transaction rolls back
T4: A commits successfully
```
**Result**: One task created, no corruption, safe to retry.

#### ResultProcessorActor (Step Result Processing)

**Protection Mechanisms**:
1. ‚úÖ **State Guards**: StateTransitionHandler checks current state
2. ‚úÖ **Coordinator Guards**: TaskCoordinator checks state before transitioning
3. ‚úÖ **Atomic Transitions**: Database-level state machine atomicity
4. ‚úÖ **Finalization Claiming**: TAS-37 atomic claiming (separate mechanism)

**Race Condition Analysis**:
```
Orchestrator A and B both receive StepExecutionResult:
T0: A loads step, state = EnqueuedForOrchestration
T0: B loads step, state = EnqueuedForOrchestration
T1: A transitions step to Complete
T1: B attempts transition step to Complete
T2: A's transition succeeds (new state row inserted)
T2: B's transition fails (state already Complete)
T3: B checks current state, sees Complete
T3: B's guard skips processing (idempotent)
```
**Result**: Step completed once, duplicate processing skipped, no corruption.

#### StepEnqueuerActor (Step Enqueueing)

**Protection Mechanisms** (assumed, not yet audited):
1. ‚úÖ **SQL Function**: `get_next_ready_tasks()` uses database-level logic
2. ‚úÖ **PGMQ Atomicity**: Message queue operations are transactional
3. ‚úÖ **Idempotent Enqueueing**: Steps can be enqueued multiple times safely

**Race Condition Analysis** (theoretical):
```
Orchestrator A and B both discover ready steps:
T0: A calls get_next_ready_tasks() ‚Üí [step1, step2]
T0: B calls get_next_ready_tasks() ‚Üí [step1, step2]
T1: A enqueues step1 to namespace queue
T1: B enqueues step1 to namespace queue
T2: Worker receives duplicate messages
T2: Worker processes step1, sends result
T3: Orchestration processes result idempotently
```
**Result**: Duplicate enqueueing is safe - workers and orchestration handle duplicates.

#### TaskFinalizerActor (Task Finalization)

**Protection Mechanisms** (TAS-37):
1. ‚úÖ **Atomic Claiming**: SQL function `claim_task_for_finalization()`
2. ‚úÖ **Compare-and-Swap**: Database-level claiming prevents duplicates
3. ‚úÖ **State Guards**: Only processes tasks in correct states

**Race Condition Analysis** (from TAS-37):
```
Orchestrator A and B both attempt finalization:
T0: A calls claim_task_for_finalization(task_uuid, A)
T0: B calls claim_task_for_finalization(task_uuid, B)
T1: SQL function executes atomically for A
T1: SQL function executes atomically for B
T2: A claims successfully (returns TRUE)
T2: B fails to claim (returns FALSE)
T3: A finalizes task
T3: B sees claim failed, skips finalization
```
**Result**: One finalization, no corruption, atomic claiming works.

### Summary: Idempotency Without Ownership

| Actor | Idempotency Mechanism | Race Condition Protection |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| TaskRequestActor | identity_hash unique constraint | Transaction atomicity |
| ResultProcessorActor | Current state guards | State machine atomicity |
| StepEnqueuerActor | SQL function atomicity | PGMQ transactional operations |
| TaskFinalizerActor | Atomic claiming (TAS-37) | SQL compare-and-swap |

**Conclusion**: All actors have independent idempotency guarantees. Processor ownership enforcement is redundant.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Configuration and Feature Flag (1-2 hours)

**Tasks**:
1. Add `enforce_processor_ownership` to EngineConfig
2. Add environment-specific defaults:
   - `test`: false (audit-only for faster testing)
   - `development`: false (audit-only for local development)
   - `production`: true initially (safe rollout)
3. Update TaskStateMachine to accept `enforce_ownership` parameter
4. Update all TaskStateMachine construction sites

**Files to Modify**:
- `tasker-shared/src/config/engine.rs`
- `tasker-shared/src/state_machine/task_state_machine.rs`
- `config/tasker/base/engine.toml`
- `config/tasker/environments/*/engine.toml`

### Phase 2: Conditional Ownership Enforcement (2-3 hours)

**Tasks**:
1. Modify `TaskStateMachine::transition()` to check flag
2. Update SystemContext to provide config value
3. Ensure processor UUID still stored (audit trail)
4. Add logging when ownership check is bypassed

**Code Changes**:
```rust
// In TaskStateMachine::transition()
if self.enforce_ownership && target_state.requires_ownership() {
    debug!(
        task_uuid = %self.task_uuid,
        target_state = ?target_state,
        processor_uuid = %self.processor_uuid,
        "Checking processor ownership (enforcement enabled)"
    );
    let current_processor = self.get_current_processor().await?;
    TransitionGuard::check_ownership(target_state, current_processor, self.processor_uuid)?;
} else if target_state.requires_ownership() {
    debug!(
        task_uuid = %self.task_uuid,
        target_state = ?target_state,
        processor_uuid = %self.processor_uuid,
        current_processor = ?self.get_current_processor().await?,
        "Audit-only mode: Processor UUID tracked but not enforced (TAS-54)"
    );
}
```

### Phase 3: Testing (3-4 hours)

#### 3.1 Unit Tests

**New Tests** (`tasker-shared/src/state_machine/task_state_machine.rs`):

```rust
#[sqlx::test]
async fn test_audit_only_mode_allows_different_processor_transition(pool: PgPool) {
    let task_uuid = Uuid::new_v4();
    let processor_a = Uuid::new_v4();
    let processor_b = Uuid::new_v4();

    // Create task with processor A
    let mut sm_a = TaskStateMachine::for_task(
        task_uuid,
        pool.clone(),
        processor_a,
        false, // ‚Üê Audit-only mode
    ).await?;

    // Transition to EvaluatingResults with processor A
    sm_a.transition(TaskEvent::StepCompleted(Uuid::new_v4())).await?;
    assert_eq!(sm_a.current_state().await?, TaskState::EvaluatingResults);

    // Now processor B tries to process (simulating crash recovery)
    let mut sm_b = TaskStateMachine::for_task(
        task_uuid,
        pool.clone(),
        processor_b, // ‚Üê Different processor
        false, // ‚Üê Audit-only mode
    ).await?;

    // Should succeed without ownership check
    let result = sm_b.transition(TaskEvent::AllStepsComplete).await;
    assert!(result.is_ok(), "Audit-only mode should allow different processor");
    assert_eq!(sm_b.current_state().await?, TaskState::Complete);
}

#[sqlx::test]
async fn test_enforcement_mode_blocks_different_processor(pool: PgPool) {
    // Same test as above but with enforce_ownership = true
    // Should fail with ownership error
}
```

#### 3.2 Integration Tests

**Crash Recovery Test** (`tests/integration/orchestration_recovery.rs`):

```rust
#[sqlx::test]
async fn test_orchestrator_crash_recovery_with_audit_only_mode() {
    // 1. Start orchestrator A
    let orchestrator_a = spawn_orchestrator(processor_uuid_a, enforce_ownership: false);

    // 2. Create task and process to EvaluatingResults
    let task_uuid = create_test_task().await?;
    send_step_result(task_uuid, step1_uuid).await?;

    // Wait for EvaluatingResults state
    wait_for_state(task_uuid, TaskState::EvaluatingResults).await?;

    // 3. Kill orchestrator A (simulating crash)
    orchestrator_a.kill().await?;

    // 4. Start orchestrator B with different UUID
    let orchestrator_b = spawn_orchestrator(processor_uuid_b, enforce_ownership: false);

    // 5. Send step result retry
    send_step_result(task_uuid, step2_uuid).await?;

    // 6. Verify task completes (not stuck)
    wait_for_state(task_uuid, TaskState::Complete).await?;

    // 7. Verify audit trail shows both processors
    let transitions = get_transitions(task_uuid).await?;
    assert!(transitions.iter().any(|t| t.processor_uuid == processor_uuid_a));
    assert!(transitions.iter().any(|t| t.processor_uuid == processor_uuid_b));
}
```

#### 3.3 Chaos Testing

**Scenario 1: Rapid Orchestrator Restarts**
- Start orchestrator, process tasks
- Kill and restart with new UUID every 5 seconds
- Verify tasks complete despite ownership changes
- Check for any race conditions or corruption

**Scenario 2: Concurrent Processing**
- Run 3 orchestrators simultaneously (different UUIDs)
- All receive same step result messages
- Verify only one processes each message
- Confirm no duplicate finalization

**Scenario 3: Database Partition**
- Simulate network split during processing
- Verify tasks don't get double-processed
- Confirm state machine guards prevent corruption

### Phase 4: Gradual Production Rollout (Phased over 1-2 weeks)

#### Stage 1: Test Environment (Day 1)
- Deploy with `enforce_processor_ownership = false`
- Run full integration test suite
- Monitor for any failures
- **Rollback criteria**: Any test failures

#### Stage 2: Development Environment (Day 2-3)
- Deploy with `enforce_processor_ownership = false`
- Team uses for local development
- Monitor for any issues
- **Rollback criteria**: Developer-reported issues

#### Stage 3: Production Canary (Day 4-7)
- Deploy with `enforce_processor_ownership = true` (keep enforcement)
- Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Prepare for flag flip

#### Stage 4: Production Flag Flip (Day 8)
- Change config to `enforce_processor_ownership = false`
- Rolling restart of orchestrators
- Monitor closely for 24 hours
- **Rollback criteria**:
  - Increase in task failures
  - Evidence of race conditions
  - Duplicate task processing
  - Any data corruption

#### Stage 5: Validation (Day 9-14)
- Verify stale task recovery works
- Confirm no regression in task completion rates
- Validate audit trail still provides debugging value
- **Success criteria**:
  - Tasks recover after orchestrator crashes
  - No increase in failures
  - Audit trail shows processor changes
  - Team confirms debugging still works

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics to Track

**Before and After Comparison**:

| Metric | Current Behavior | After TAS-54 |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| Stuck tasks (>5min in active state) | Increases after crashes | Should decrease |
| Task completion rate | 99.x% (excluding stuck) | Should maintain or improve |
| Manual interventions | Several per day | Should approach zero |
| Orchestrator restarts | Causes stuck tasks | Should not impact tasks |
| Audit trail completeness | 100% | Maintained at 100% |

**New Alerts**:

1. **Processor Ownership Changes**
   ```
   Alert: Task {task_uuid} processor changed from {processor_a} to {processor_b}
   Severity: Info
   Purpose: Track recovery events
   ```

2. **Rapid State Transitions**
   ```
   Alert: Task {task_uuid} had {count} transitions in {time_window}
   Severity: Warning if count > 10 in 1 minute
   Purpose: Detect potential race conditions
   ```

3. **Stale Task Recovery**
   ```
   Alert: Task {task_uuid} recovered after {duration} in {state}
   Severity: Info
   Purpose: Measure effectiveness of solution
   ```

### Dashboard Updates

**Add Panels**:
- Processor ownership changes per hour
- Tasks recovered after orchestrator crashes
- Average time to recovery for stuck tasks
- Distribution of processors per task completion

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Mitigated)

**Risk**: Race conditions cause duplicate processing
- **Likelihood**: Low - idempotency audit shows protections exist
- **Impact**: High - could cause data corruption
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive testing before rollout
  - Chaos testing with concurrent orchestrators
  - Feature flag allows instant rollback
  - Extensive monitoring for duplicates

### Medium Risk (Acceptable)

**Risk**: Audit trail shows unusual processor changes
- **Likelihood**: High - expected behavior after crashes
- **Impact**: Low - debugging remains possible, just different pattern
- **Mitigation**:
  - Update runbooks with new patterns
  - Train team on audit-only interpretation
  - Add documentation for investigating ownership changes

### Low Risk (Acceptable)

**Risk**: Unknown edge cases not covered by tests
- **Likelihood**: Low - architecture audit was thorough
- **Impact**: Medium - could cause task failures
- **Mitigation**:
  - Gradual rollout with monitoring
  - Feature flag allows quick revert
  - Comprehensive integration and chaos testing

---

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)

**Trigger Conditions**:
- Increase in task failure rate >5%
- Evidence of data corruption
- Duplicate task processing detected
- Critical system instability

**Rollback Procedure**:
1. Set `enforce_processor_ownership = true` in production config
2. Rolling restart orchestrators (updates in-memory config)
3. Verify tasks return to previous behavior
4. Investigate root cause offline

**No Database Changes Required**: Processor UUID data unchanged

### Configuration-Only Rollback

**Advantage**: Can toggle between modes instantly
- No code deployment needed
- No database migration needed
- No schema changes needed
- Zero downtime

**Files to Change**:
```toml
# config/tasker/environments/production/engine.toml
[engine]
enforce_processor_ownership = true  # Revert to enforcement
```

Then: `kubectl rollout restart deployment/orchestration` (or equivalent)

### Monitoring After Rollback

- Verify stuck task count stabilizes
- Confirm no regression from rollback
- Document what caused the rollback
- Update tests to cover the scenario

## Open Questions

1. **Performance Impact**: Does removing ownership check improve transition latency?
   - **Answer**: Likely yes - one fewer database query per transition
   - **Measure**: Compare P95 transition latency before/after

2. **Concurrent Finalization**: Can TAS-37 atomic claiming handle high concurrency?
   - **Answer**: Should test under load
   - **Action**: Include in chaos testing

3. **Audit Trail Queries**: Do existing debugging queries still work?
   - **Answer**: Need to verify all admin/debugging interfaces
   - **Action**: Test admin panel, CLI tools, grafana dashboards

4. **Historical Data**: What about tasks stuck before this change?
   - **Answer**: Will require one-time manual recovery or automated script
   - **Action**: Create recovery script for stuck tasks in active states

### Key Evidence from Audit

**TaskRequestActor Idempotency** (`phase1-findings.md:138-248`):
- identity_hash unique constraint prevents duplicates
- Transaction atomicity ensures all-or-nothing
- Already operates with audit-only processor UUID

**ResultProcessorActor Blocking** (`phase1-findings.md:417-454`):
- Ownership check prevents recovery after crashes
- State guards already provide idempotency
- Processor UUID enforcement is root cause of TAS-54

---

**Recommendation**: Proceed with implementation. Evidence strongly supports audit-only approach.
