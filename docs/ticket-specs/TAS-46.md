# TAS-46: Actor-Based Architecture for Lifecycle Components

## Problem Statement

The current orchestration system uses a command pattern with direct service delegation, but lacks formal boundaries between commands and lifecycle components. This creates several challenges:

### Current Issues

1. **Testing Complexity**: Lifecycle components are tightly coupled to command processor, making isolated testing difficult
2. **Unclear Boundaries**: No formal interface between commands and lifecycle operations
3. **Limited Supervision**: No standardized lifecycle hooks for resource management
4. **Inconsistent Patterns**: Each component has different initialization and coordination patterns
5. **Coupling**: Command processor has direct dependencies on multiple service instances

### Goals

- Formalize relationship between Commands and Lifecycle Components using Actor pattern
- Improve testability through message-based interfaces
- Provide supervision hooks for resource management (started/stopped)
- Establish consistent patterns across all lifecycle components
- Enable better isolation and independent testing of actors

### Non-Goals

- Full actor framework (like Actix) - keeping it lightweight
- Backward compatibility - greenfield migration approach
- Complex actor supervision trees - simple lifecycle hooks only

## Implementation Strategy

### Design Principles

1. **Lightweight Actor Pattern**: Minimal abstraction, not a full actor framework
2. **Message-Based Communication**: Type-safe messages via `Handler<M>` trait
3. **Service Wrapping**: Actors wrap existing sophisticated services
4. **Greenfield Migration**: Direct replacement without dual support
5. **Shared Ownership**: Arc-wrapped actors for efficient cloning across threads

### Architecture

```
OrchestrationCommand ────→ ActorRegistry ────→ Specific Actor
                                │                      │
                                │                      ├─→ Handler<M>
                                │                      │
                                └──────────────────────┴─→ Lifecycle Component
```

### Core Abstractions

#### 1. OrchestrationActor Trait
Base trait for all actors with lifecycle hooks:
- `name()` - Actor identification
- `context()` - Access to SystemContext
- `started()` - Optional initialization hook
- `stopped()` - Optional cleanup hook

#### 2. Message Trait
Marker trait for command messages:
- Associated `Response` type for type-safe returns
- Simple marker, no additional methods required

#### 3. Handler<M> Trait
Message handling for specific message types:
- `async fn handle(&self, msg: M) -> TaskerResult<Self::Response>`
- Type-safe message processing
- Async support via async_trait

#### 4. ActorRegistry
Central registry managing all actors:
- Lazy initialization during build
- Calls `started()` on all actors during construction
- Provides shared Arc references to actors
- Manages shutdown in reverse initialization order

### Migration Approach

**Greenfield Migration** (no dual support):
1. Create actor wrapping existing service
2. Add actor to ActorRegistry
3. Update command processor to use actor
4. Mark legacy service field as `#[allow(dead_code)]`
5. Verify with tests

### Phased Implementation

#### Phase 1: Core Abstractions + Test Harness ✅
- Define `OrchestrationActor`, `Message`, and `Handler<M>` traits
- Create `ActorRegistry` with lifecycle management
- Add comprehensive tests for trait implementations
- Establish patterns for subsequent actors

#### Phase 2: Primary Orchestration Actors ✅
- **TaskRequestActor**: Task initialization and request processing
- **ResultProcessorActor**: Step result processing and task finalization

#### Phase 3: Supporting Actors (Planned)
- **StepEnqueuerActor**: Step enqueueing coordination
- **TaskFinalizerActor**: Task finalization with atomic claiming
- **TaskInitializerActor**: Task initialization logic

#### Phase 4: Advanced Actors (Future)
- Event system actors for orchestration and worker coordination
- Health check and metrics actors
- Additional coordination actors as needed

**Tests Passing:**
- All 54 tasker-orchestration library tests pass
- Config integration tests pass (7 tests)
- Actor trait compilation tests pass
- ActorRegistry lifecycle tests pass

### Migration Pattern Established

The greenfield migration pattern is now well-established:

1. **Create Actor File**
   - Define message struct with request data
   - Implement `Message` trait with `Response` type
   - Create actor struct with `context` and `service` fields
   - Implement `OrchestrationActor` trait with lifecycle hooks
   - Implement `Handler<M>` trait delegating to service

2. **Update ActorRegistry**
   - Add actor field: `pub actor_name: Arc<ActorName>`
   - Create dependencies in `build()` method
   - Create actor instance and call `started()`
   - Wrap in Arc and add to registry
   - Update `shutdown()` to call `stopped()` in reverse order

3. **Update Command Processor**
   - Add message type to imports
   - Update handler method to create message and call `actor.handle(msg).await`
   - Mark old service field as `#[allow(dead_code)]`
   - Update comments to reference TAS-46

4. **Verify**
   - Run clippy to check compilation
   - Run library tests to verify functionality
   - Run integration tests for end-to-end validation

## Remaining Work

### Phase 3: Supporting Actors (Next)

**StepEnqueuerActor** (Planned):
- Message: `EnqueueStepsMessage` with task context
- Service: `StepEnqueuerService`
- Response: Step enqueuing result
- Used by: TaskInitializer, TaskFinalizer

**TaskFinalizerActor** (Planned):
- Message: `FinalizeTaskMessage` with task UUID
- Service: `TaskFinalizer`
- Response: Finalization result with claim status
- Integration: TAS-37 atomic claiming preserved

**TaskInitializerActor** (Planned):
- Message: `InitializeTaskMessage` with task request
- Service: `TaskInitializer`
- Response: Initialization result with task UUID
- Integration: Step discovery and initial enqueueing

### Command Processor Cleanup

**Remaining Direct Calls to Migrate:**
- `handle_finalize_task()` - Currently calls `TaskFinalizer` directly
- `handle_enqueue_ready_steps()` - Currently calls `StepEnqueuerService` directly
- Message-based processing variants that still use services directly

**Dead Code Removal** (After Phase 3):
- Remove `task_request_processor` field (already marked dead)
- Remove `result_processor` field (already marked dead)
- Remove `task_claim_step_enqueuer` field (after StepEnqueuerActor)
- Update `OrchestrationProcessor::new()` signature to remove unused params

- [ ] Performance validated (no significant overhead)
- [ ] Production deployment validated

## Performance Considerations

### Design Optimizations

1. **Arc-Wrapped Actors**: Single pointer clone instead of full registry clone
2. **Async Message Handling**: Non-blocking actor operations
3. **Service Delegation**: Actors delegate to existing optimized services
4. **No Message Queues**: Direct async fn calls, no channel overhead
5. **Shared Dependencies**: Single Arc<Service> shared across actors

### Expected Overhead

- **Message Creation**: ~10-50ns per message struct creation
- **Actor Call**: ~100-500ns for trait dispatch + async overhead
- **Arc Clone**: ~10ns for reference count increment
- **Total Per Operation**: <1μs additional overhead vs direct service call

### Monitoring Points

- Command processing latency (before/after actor migration)
- Memory usage with multiple Arc-wrapped actors
- Thread contention on ActorRegistry access
- Message handling throughput

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- `tasker-shared`: Core types, traits, error handling
- `OrchestrationProcessor`: Command pattern integration
- Lifecycle services: TaskRequestProcessor, OrchestrationResultProcessor, etc.
- SystemContext: Dependency injection for actors

### External Dependencies

- `async-trait`: Async trait support for Handler<M>
- `tokio`: Async runtime for actor operations
- `tracing`: Logging in lifecycle hooks

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Performance Overhead

**Risk**: Actor abstraction adds latency to critical path

**Mitigation**:
- Thin wrapper design with direct service delegation
- Arc for efficient sharing
- Performance benchmarks to validate
- Async operations for non-blocking behavior

### Risk 2: Migration Complexity

**Risk**: Multiple actors to migrate could introduce bugs

**Mitigation**:
- Phased approach (2 actors at a time)
- Comprehensive testing after each phase
- Greenfield migration (clean replacement)
- Established pattern from Phase 2

### Risk 3: Testing Gaps

**Risk**: Actor interactions might have untested edge cases

**Mitigation**:
- Unit tests for each actor
- Integration tests for actor coordination
- E2E tests for full workflows
- Explicit test verification step before proceeding

## Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Why Greenfield Migration?**: Codebase is actively developed, simpler to replace than support dual modes
2. **Why Not Full Actor Framework?**: Avoiding complexity; lightweight pattern sufficient for our needs
3. **Why Arc<ActorRegistry>?**: Efficient sharing across command processor threads
4. **Why Unit Response Type?**: ResultProcessorActor doesn't need to return data, just report success/failure
5. **Why Shared StepEnqueuerService?**: Multiple actors need step enqueueing; shared Arc avoids duplication

### Lessons Learned (Phase 2)

1. **Import Paths Matter**: `StepExecutionResult` is at `tasker_shared::` not `tasker_shared::models::core::`
2. **Error Conversion Needed**: OrchestrationError doesn't auto-convert to TaskerError
3. **Arc Efficiency**: Single Arc clone vs full struct clone is significant for command threads
4. **Test Early**: Running clippy immediately catches structural issues
5. **Pattern Consistency**: Established pattern makes subsequent actors trivial

### Future Enhancements

1. **Actor Metrics**: Add metrics for message handling latency, throughput
2. **Actor Tracing**: Distributed tracing across actor message flows
3. **Actor Testing Harness**: Specialized test utilities for actor isolation
4. **Actor Supervision**: More sophisticated error handling and recovery
5. **Actor Composition**: Higher-level actors coordinating multiple actors
