# Archive Documentation Index

## Overview

This archive contains consolidated documentation from multiple architectural iterations of tasker-core-rs. These documents preserve valuable strategic insights, technical lessons learned, and proven methodologies while removing obsolete implementation details.

## Current Architecture Context

**tasker-core-rs** has evolved through several major architectural phases:
- **ZeroMQ pub-sub** ‚Üí **TCP command architecture** ‚Üí **pgmq (PostgreSQL message queues)**

The current production architecture uses **pgmq** for queue-based workflow orchestration with autonomous Ruby workers. These archived documents contain insights that remain valuable regardless of the underlying messaging architecture.

## Legacy Content Removed

The following categories of content were removed during consolidation:
- **Implementation-specific details** for obsolete architectures
- **TODO lists** and development plans for completed work
- **Placeholder code** and temporary solutions
- **Duplicate analysis** across multiple documents
- **Debug sessions** and troubleshooting logs

All valuable strategic insights from these removed documents have been preserved and consolidated into the five remaining documents.

## Document Quality

Each consolidated document follows these standards:
- **Evergreen Content**: Focuses on principles and patterns that remain valid
- **Production Proven**: Based on real-world implementation experience
- **Strategic Focus**: Emphasizes decision-making insights over implementation details
- **Clear Audience**: Targeted to specific engineering roles and use cases
