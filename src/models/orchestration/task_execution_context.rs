//! # Task Execution Context - Real-Time Task Status
//!
//! **CRITICAL**: This is NOT a database table - it's a computed view via SQL functions.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The `TaskExecutionContext` represents dynamically computed execution state and statistics
//! for workflow tasks. Unlike other models, this data is **never stored** - it's calculated
//! on-demand using sophisticated SQL functions that analyze step states and dependencies.
//!
//! ## Human-Readable Explanation
//!
//! Think of this as a "task dashboard" that gives you a real-time snapshot of what's happening
//! with any workflow task. It answers critical questions for monitoring and orchestration:
//!
//! - **"How is my task doing?"** (Overall execution status and health)
//! - **"How much progress has been made?"** (Completion percentage and step counts)
//! - **"What can I do next?"** (Recommended actions based on current state)
//! - **"Are there any problems?"** (Failed steps and error conditions)
//! - **"What's ready to run?"** (Steps that can be executed immediately)
//!
//! ### Real-World Example
//!
//! For a data processing workflow with 10 steps:
//! ```text
//! Task: "Daily Sales Report Generation"
//! Status: "in_progress"
//! Progress: 7/10 steps complete (70%)
//! Ready: 2 steps ready to run
//! Failed: 1 step failed
//! Health: "degraded" (due to failure)
//! Action: "retry_failed_steps"
//! ```
//!
//! This tells you immediately that the task is mostly done but has issues that need attention.
//!
//! ## SQL Function Integration
//!
//! This module integrates with two key PostgreSQL functions:
//!
//! ### 1. `get_task_execution_context(input_task_id bigint)`
//! - Computes execution context for a single task
//! - Returns comprehensive statistics and status analysis
//! - Uses CTEs and step readiness functions for efficient calculation
//!
//! ### 2. `get_task_execution_contexts_batch(input_task_ids bigint[])`
//! - Batch computation for multiple tasks simultaneously
//! - Optimized for dashboard and bulk operations
//! - Reduces database round trips for large-scale analysis
//!
//! ## Function Return Schema
//!
//! Both functions return identical table structure:
//! ```sql
//! RETURNS TABLE(
//!   task_id bigint,
//!   named_task_id integer,
//!   status text,
//!   total_steps bigint,
//!   pending_steps bigint,
//!   in_progress_steps bigint,
//!   completed_steps bigint,
//!   failed_steps bigint,
//!   ready_steps bigint,
//!   execution_status text,
//!   recommended_action text,
//!   completion_percentage numeric,
//!   health_status text
//! )
//! ```
//!
//! ## Performance Characteristics
//!
//! - **No Storage Overhead**: No tables to maintain or indexes to update
//! - **Always Current**: Real-time calculation ensures data is never stale
//! - **Efficient Computation**: Leverages existing indexes on steps and transitions
//! - **Batch Optimization**: Single query can analyze hundreds of tasks
//!
//! ## Rails Heritage
//!
//! Migrated from `app/models/tasker/task_execution_context.rb` (967B)
//! The Rails model was a thin wrapper around the same SQL functions.
